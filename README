Interactive Data Visualisations for Valentina Melgar Bermúdez' Master's research. 
Overview

This page presents three interactive data visualizations created based on my Master’s degree research. The visualizations are designed to explore and communicate patterns within the collected dataset through different visual perspectives.

The page consists of three screens:

A map, geolocating Brazilian citizen labs;
A Venn diagram, showing how the datasets ecosystem is composed;
A pie chart, showing the different networks that compose the lab ecosystem as well.

All visuals are dynamic and driven by structured data stored in attached JSON files.

Navigation & External Links

The page header includes direct links to:
The full Master’s thesis (in Spanish), providing academic context and detailed methodology;
My Substack newsletter, where related ideas and research reflections are published;
My LinkedIn profile, for professional and academic background.

These links are provided for reference, transparency, and further exploration of the research context.
