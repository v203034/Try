Interactive Data Visualisations for Master’s Thesis
Overview

This page presents three interactive data visualisations created as part of my Master’s degree research. The visualisations are designed to explore and communicate patterns within the collected dataset through different visual perspectives.

The page consists of three screens:

A map visualisation

A Venn diagram

A chart-based visualisation

All visuals are dynamic and driven by structured data stored in attached JSON files.

Navigation & External Links

The page header includes direct links to:

The full Master’s thesis, providing academic context and detailed methodology

My Substack newsletter, where related ideas and research reflections are published

My LinkedIn profile, for professional and academic background

These links are provided for reference, transparency, and further exploration of the research context.

Visualisations Included
1. Map

An interactive map displaying geographically referenced data from the dataset. Users can explore spatial relationships and distributions.

2. Venn Diagram

A dynamic Venn diagram used to illustrate overlaps and relationships between key data categories.

3. Chart

A chart-based visualisation presenting quantitative comparisons and trends derived from the data.

Data

All visualisations are generated from locally stored JSON files.

The data was gathered and prepared specifically for this Master’s degree project.

No external APIs are used; all data is loaded directly from the provided files.

Assets & Credits

Some visual assets and icons were sourced from pngtree.

These assets are used for visual enhancement only and do not represent data.

AI Assistance Disclosure

Code generation and refinement

Structuring visualisation logic

General implementation guidance

All data collection, analytical decisions, and final design choices were made by the author.

Purpose & Academic Context

This project was developed as part of a Master’s degree and is intended for:

Academic review

Demonstration of data visualisation techniques

Exploration of research data in an interactive format

It is not intended for commercial use.

Usage

Open the page in a modern web browser. No additional setup is required, provided the JSON data files remain in their original locations.
